// Testing was performed using "the arena floor", a 3lb class combat robot. (It has lost two fights, won zero. Do not judge based on numbers. Judge based on me saying it's a terrible robot.)

//     - while your robot might be designed to be tough and resilient, it's best not to see how it deals with being thrown across the room.
//       - you may be wrong about how strong it is.
//       - it may land on a weak point.
//       - your room might not be as strong as your robot.

// Design and use tips

// The receiver should connect to RX2 (pin 7) of the Teensy and a common ground pin.
// The signal pins from the ESCs should be connected to pins 2 and 3, and the ground
// pins to ground.

// I use a custom circuit board to hold things together, but it's still evolving
// so I won't share it yet.

// The robot should have red, green, and blue LEDs (all with resistors) on -ve side
// of the appropriately named ports. The other side should be connected to 5v.
// The logic driving the LEDs in updateLEDs is inverted, with literal 1 turning the
// LED off, and a 0 turning it on. Red LEDs have fwd voltage of about 1.6-2.2v, but
// we are connecting the negative lead to 3.3v, and the positive lead to 5v. With
// the negative lead supplying 3.3v, the potential difference over the LED is only
// 1.7v, which isn't enough to brightly light up a red LED, and nowhere near enough
// to light up a green or blue one. When the LED pin goes to 0v, the difference
// becomes 5v, and all the LEDs are brightly illuminated. This is probably bad
// for the Teensy.

// the IBus connection needs a hardware serial port. The IBusBM library doesn't
// support Teensy by default: it does compile, but it sends a warning message.
// I couldn't easily add perfect support, but I removed the warning part in the
// begin() method about being an unsupported board so it compiles cleanly, and
// I call the ibus.loop() method manually. (it might already be called on the timer
// I added as well, but I have no idea how to tell at the moment.) It's not like
// this makes the code any worse.
